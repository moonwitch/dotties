# .dotfiles

This is my public repo in which I save various dotfiles. I haven't gotten them very robust, so please don't just drop them onto your system. _This will eat puppies and slay kittens._

# Installation

Simple; dead simple.

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonwitch/dotties/master/install.sh)"

# Notes

I use submodules to add themes/icons, because some apps still use GTK2 and others GTK3 I have to set both. 
It's important to match both themes, otherwise it will look awful.
